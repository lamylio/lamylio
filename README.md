### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started developing around the age of 12 by starting to learn **Java** to develop Minecraft plugins (yup). I then had to learn **HTML/CSS**, **PHP** and **SQL** to link my projects to a user interface.  After a long period of focusing mainly on web development (wink to **NodeJS**), I started to get interested in statistics and artificial intelligence and a bunch of other cool stuffs. Long story short, here I am, a _graduate in data science_, where I now mainly use **Python** and **R**.

**TLDR**: I really enjoy to code, so **hit me up** so we can collaborate on future projects! âœ¨\
(_That's a big brain move_ ðŸ§ )
